# Meeting-Summarizer-and-plan-of-action-generator-using-NLP

## Overview
This project leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to provide comprehensive meeting summaries and actionable plans. It processes video/audio files to extract key information, analyze sentiment and tone, and generate summaries. Additionally, it includes a feature to send emails with the summarized information to respective recipients.

## Features
- **Video/Audio Processing:** Converts video files to audio using `ffmpeg` and removes silent regions using `pydub`.
- **Transcription:** Uses OpenAI's Whisper `base-model` to transcribe audio files into text.
- **Summarization:** Utilizes OpenAI's `gemini-1.5-flash` model to generate meeting summaries.
- **Sentiment and Tone Analysis:** Analyzes the sentiment and tone of the meeting content.
- **Plan of Action:** Generates a plan of action based on the meeting content.
- **Email Sending:** Sends the summarized information and plan of action using mail management system.

## Audio Processing and Text Preprocessing

### Audio Processing

The project utilizes several audio processing techniques to prepare meeting recordings for analysis and summarization:

- **Conversion to Audio:** Video files are converted to audio using `ffmpeg`, facilitating easier processing of the meeting content without visual data.
  
- **Silent Region Removal:** `pydub` is employed to remove silent regions from the audio files. This preprocessing step helps in focusing the analysis on meaningful speech segments, improving the accuracy of transcription and subsequent NLP tasks.

### Text Preprocessing

Before applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract meeting summaries and plans of action, the transcribed text undergoes preprocessing to enhance the quality of analysis:

- **Tokenization:** The transcribed text is segmented into individual tokens (words or phrases) to facilitate further analysis.
  
- **Stopword Removal:** Common stopwords (e.g., "the", "is", "and") are removed from the text to reduce noise and improve the relevance of extracted information.


These preprocessing steps are crucial for optimizing the performance of the summarization and sentiment analysis models, ensuring that the generated summaries are concise, relevant, and accurately reflect the content and sentiment of the meetings.


## Email Management System

The project automates email communication by dynamically sending summarized meeting information and plans of action to designated recipients based on the user's choice. The system now features an interactive frontend and a robust backend for managing this process.

### Frontend Implementation

The frontend of the email management system has been built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to create a user-friendly and responsive interface. Key aspects of the design include:

- **HTML Structure:** A clean and semantic HTML layout that organizes the form fields for selecting recipients and reviewing the summary and plan of action.
  
- **CSS Styling:** Modern and minimalistic CSS styling ensures a professional look and feel. Buttons, forms, and the layout are responsive, with attention given to user experience, accessibility, and readability. The design is tailored to be both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

- **JavaScript Interactivity:** JavaScript enhances the user experience by dynamically handling form submissions, recipient selection, and asynchronous communication with the backend via API calls. It ensures a smooth and responsive interface when sending emails and interacting with the summarizer.

### Backend Integration

The backend is powered by **FastAPI**, which handles the email sending logic and integrates seamlessly with the frontend through API endpoints. Key functions include:

- **Mail Data Submission:** When a user selects the email recipients, the email IDs are submitted as a list based on the meeting type. The form data, including the list of recipients and the summary content, is sent to FastAPI. The backend processes the input and prepares the email content for each recipient in the list.

- **Email Sending Logic:** The FastAPI backend composes the email, which includes the meeting summary and plan of action generated by the NLP models. It then sends the email to the selected recipients using an SMTP service. The system dynamically selects recipients based on the meeting type, ensuring accurate and timely communication.

- **API Communication:** The frontend communicates with the backend using FastAPIâ€™s APIs, ensuring efficient handling of requests and responses. This structure provides scalability and flexibility, allowing the system to handle multiple meetings and recipients.

This integration of HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend and FastAPI for the backend ensures a smooth, scalable, and efficient user experience. The email management system automates communication by sending the summarized meeting information and actionable plans directly to the relevant stakeholders with just a few clicks.
